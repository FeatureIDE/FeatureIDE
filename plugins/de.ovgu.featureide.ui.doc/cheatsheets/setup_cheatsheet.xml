Welcome to the FeatureIDE tutorial.<br/>
This tutorial will help you to build your first FeatureIDE project. After you have finished this tutorial, you will have a simple Hello World software product line. If you have problems at a certain step, you can get the final result using File-&gt; New-&gt; Example.<br/><br/>
The first step for your product line is domain engineering. Here you think about what features to provide for your product. For further information about software product line engineering use the help button. This picture will show you the basic idea between domain engineering and application engineering.<br/><br/>
Let&apos;s get started!

When using FeatureIDE it is best to activate the FeatureIDE perspective. Thus, the first step is to switch the active perspective to the <b>FeatureIDE</b> perspective. You can use the button on the upper right corner of the workbench.<br/><br/>
Click &quot;Click to Perform&quot; to open the &quot;FeatureIDE&quot; perspective automatically.

Next, create a new project. You can find the <b>FeatureProject</b> wizard under File-&gt; New. You can also start the wizard by clicking on the button below (Click to perform).<br/><br/>
In the wizard you can select different composition engines. You can choose any composition engine but remember your decision for later steps in this tutorial.<br/>
(You can find a short introduction to alternative composition engines at the end of this cheat sheet)<br/>
On the next page, choose a project name. For example &quot;HelloWorld&quot;. Then, close the wizard by clicking Finish.
