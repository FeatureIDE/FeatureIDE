/**
 * The feature model interface represents any class that acts in the sense of a <i>feature model</i> in FeatureIDE. <br/> <br/> A feature model contains of a
 * modifiable collection of <ul> <li>{@link de.ovgu.featureide.fm.core.base.IFeature Features}, and</li> <li>{@link de.ovgu.featureide.fm.core.base.IConstraint
 * Constraints of features}</li> </ul> <br/> Each <i>feature</i> in a feature model has a unique identifier and is related to other features over some
 * expressions and relations which forms the feature model (such as parent-children relation with implication expression from one feature to another).
 * Additional to the structure of features (see {@link de.ovgu.featureide.fm.core.base.IFeature} and {@link de.ovgu.featureide.fm.core.base.IFeatureStructure}
 * for more details) inside the feature models tree, features relationships can be further expressed using <i>constraints</i>. While the feature structure is
 * bound to the actual feature model tree, constraints can be state restrictions and relations to arbitrary features inside the feature model. <br/> <br/>
 * Features inside a feature model can by analyzed in order to determine feature properties which are implicated by the structure, the statements, and the
 * constraints. As a result of such an analysis, a set of <i>dead features</i> can be found for instance. For more information about analysis, see
 * {@link de.ovgu.featureide.fm.core.FeatureModelAnalyzer FeatureModelAnalyzer}. <br/> <br/> Additional to the collection mentioned above, the feature model
 * contains properties to express <ul> <li>Annotations</li> <li>Comments</li> <li>Feature Orders</li> </ul> <br/> A feature model is moreover related to it's
 * project, such that the <i>project's name</i> can be received, the related composer extension can be received, as well as certain event handling logic (such
 * as model data change event handling) can be made. Furthermore, each feature model is <i>required to has an own unique system-wide identifier</i> (at least
 * during runtime). Any implementation of this interface has to provide the corresponding {@link #getId()} method and have to implement the management of
 * identifiers among a set of feature models. <br/> <br/> Any feature model is intended to be instantiated by a corresponding factory, the
 * implementation-specific {@link IFeatureModelFactory feature model factory}. <br/> <br/> FeatureIDE provides a default implementation
 * {@link de.ovgu.featureide.fm.core.base.impl.FeatureModel FeatureModel} which is used for default use-cases and can be customized via inheritance of
 * {@link de.ovgu.featureide.fm.core.base.impl.FeatureModel feature model} and a user-defined {@IFeatureModelFactory feature model factory}. Internally, a
 * feature model is represented by an unique numeric identifier, which should be considered in the related {@link IFeatureModelFactory feature model factory} in
 * order to avoid confusion with other models. <br/> <br/> <b>Example</b><br/> The following example demonstrate the creation of a new feature model using
 * FeatureIDE's default <code>FeatureModel</code> implementation {@link de.ovgu.featureide.fm.core.base.impl.FeatureModel FeatureModel}, and the corresponding
 * default factory {@link de.ovgu.featureide.fm.core.base.impl.DefaultFeatureModelFactory DefaultFeatureModelFactory} over the conviennent factory class
 * {@link FMFactoryManager}: <code> <pre> IFeatureModel model = FMFactoryManager.getFactory().createFeatureModel(); </pre> </code> A unified handling of certain
 * <code>IFeature</code>, and <code>IFeatureModel</code> implementations (in terms of conviennent methods) can be achieved with the use of
 * {@link de.ovgu.featureide.fm.core.base.FeatureUtils FeatureUtils} helper class. <br/> <br/> <b>Caching notes</b>: A feature model implementation using the
 * <code>IFeatureModel</code> interface has to provide a map of feature names to the corresponding feature objects, the <i>feature table</i>. This data
 * structure is used in the {@link RenamingsManager} for instance. If the implementation utilizes this data structure for internal use, modifications to this
 * data structure must be protected against concurrent accesses. The default implementations {@link FeatureModel} uses a <code>ConcurrentHashMap</code> for this
 * purpose. <br/> <br/> <b>API notes</b>: The classes internal structure has heavily changed compared to older FeatureIDE version. A bridge to the old-fashioned
 * handling is available in {@link de.ovgu.featureide.fm.core.base.FeatureUtils FeatureUtils} as static methods. <br/> <br/> <b>Notes on thread safeness</b>: At
 * least the management of <code>IFeature</code> and </code>IFeatureModel</code> identifiers (e.g., getting the next free id) have to be thread safe. The
 * reference default implementation for feature models is <code> <pre> private static long NEXT_ID = 0;
 *
 * protected static final synchronized long getNextId() { return NEXT_ID++; } </pre> </code> <br/> <br/> <b>Compatibility Notes</b>: To provide compatibility to
 * earlier versions of FeatureIDE, the <i>out-dated</i> class {@link de.ovgu.featureide.fm.core.FeatureModel FeatureModel} is now a wrapper to an
 * <code>IFeatureModel</code> instance (but incompatible to it) and make use of convert-functionalities inside
 * {@link de.ovgu.featureide.fm.core.base.FeatureUtils FeatureUtils}.
