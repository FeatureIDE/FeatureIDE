How to add an example project:

1. Put the project folder in the folder "featureide_example".
2. Remove unnecessary files in the project (e.g., bin files).
3. Run build.xml as ANT script. (Mind the console output!)
4. (Optional) Refresh "featureide_example" folder.
5. (Optional) Modify the newly created projectInformation.xml file in the project folder.
