<title>Digraph Samples</title>

<p>
This package contains samples of JML specifications
for directed graphs.  It contains two sets of examples.
</p>

<p>
The type <a href="ArcType.html">ArcType</a>,
<a href="NodeType.html">NodeType</a>,
and <a href="Digraph.html">Digraph</a>
are used in the preliminary design document.  These were mostly
written originally by Albert Baker.
</p>

<p>
The remaining types (that are not about testing) are perhaps better
examples of directed graphs in practice.  These were written and
implemented by Katie Becker, under the supervision of Gary T. Leavens.
Their implentations were later refined by Gary T. Leavens.
