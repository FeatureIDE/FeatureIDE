Supported Operators

EqualsOperator
	" == " <--> " != "
	 
GreaterThanEqualsOperator
	" >= " <--> " <= "
...

For all Mutation Operators, they only apply if the target pattern is separated with whitespace from the surrounding code, 
e.g.,
5<=3 will NOT be mutated
5 <= 3 will be mutated (to 5 >= 3)
5<= 3 will NOT be mutated

TODO: 

-allow the use of regex patterns for definition of operators 
	-allow distinction between specification and implementation mutations (requires regex support)
	-add further mutation operators

-allow applying a specified number of mutations (instead of all possible mutations)
