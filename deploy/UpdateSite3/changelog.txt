  references in constraints are replaced by other features if possible)

  indeterminate if there is no constraint A <=> H, where A is a conjunction of
  non-hidden features and there is no logically equivalent non-hidden feature
  that can be used to determine the selection of H)

* Property page for feature model editor to change appearance of the feature
  diagram (right click on a FeatureIDE project -> Properties -> FeatureIDE -> 
  Feature Model Editor)
* Property page for FeatureIDE projects to change directories or the generator
  (right click on a FeatureIDE project -> Properties -> FeatureIDE -> Feature
  Project)

  modeling only
